# House-Price-Dataset
# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features like number of rooms, location, area, etc. The project is implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab**, and applies common ML techniques like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **House Prices** dataset from Kaggle or a similar CSV-based dataset. It contains various features of houses like:
- Area
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location
- Year built
- ...and more


## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**  
2. **Load Dataset** (via file upload or Google Drive)  
3. **Explore and Visualize Data**  
4. **Preprocess Data** – handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features  
5. **Train-Test Split**  
6. **Model Building** – Linear Regression, Random Forest, or others  
7. **Evaluation** – Mean Squared Error, R² Score  
8. **Visualization of Results**  
9. *(Optional)*: Save the trained model using `joblib` or `pickle`
